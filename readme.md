# Pickless
Pickless **completely removes pickaxes** from Minecraft, for a unique challenge.

## Changes
- All pick crafting recipes are removed.
- Any pick items will automatically be randomly converted to either a shovel or axe of the same material and enchantments. Replacement occurs:
  - in players' inventories
  - in nearby containers
  - in entities (like chest minecarts or donkeys)
  - for items dropped on the ground
  - in villager trades
- The two advancements that can only be obtained by getting a pick have been removed.

## Progression
Because picks are required to mine stone and ores, cobblestone, metals, and even the ability to smelt become much more difficult to obtain.

Some options you have:
- Use furnaces in villages
- Use creepers or TNT to blow up stone and/or ores
- Loot enough iron to craft a bucket so you can get to the nether
- Barter with piglins for blackstone as a cobble replacement
- Make an iron farm from villagers spawning iron golemns
