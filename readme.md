# Pickless
Pickless **completely removes pickaxes** from Minecraft, for a unique challenge. To compensate, it tweaks which blocks can be broken by which tools and adds many new systems to break certain blocks

## Goodbye Pickaxes
- All pick crafting recipes are removed.
- Any pick items will automatically be randomly converted to either a shovel or axe of the same material and enchantments. Replacement occurs:
  - in players' inventories
  - in nearby containers
  - in entities (like chest minecarts or donkeys)
  - for items dropped on the ground
  - in villager trades
- The two advancements that can only be obtained by getting a pick have been removed.
